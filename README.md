# TraceIntel

## Overview
**TraceIntel** is an open-source **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and Social Media Monitoring** tool with a focus on **cyber safety**, **tech-abuse prevention**, and **digital footprint monitoring**. The tool aims to help both professionals and non-technical users gather intelligence, monitor social media for specific keywords and sensitive information, and protect personal privacy. **TraceIntel** includes features for detecting potential **sensitive data leaks** in both text and images on social media platforms.

### Core Features
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Continuously scans platforms (like Twitter, Reddit) for relevant keywords and patterns (e.g., phishing, harassment).
- **Keyword & Hashtag Alerts**: Sends real-time alerts when specific keywords or hashtags are detected.
- **Image Analysis for Sensitive Data**: Detects and analyzes images for sensitive information such as keys, addresses, or identifying details that could be exploited.
- **Leak Detection**: Integrates with services like **HaveIBeenPwned** to detect leaked credentials or personal information exposure.
- **Tech-Abuse Prevention**: Focuses on helping victims of tech abuse by analyzing data and images to spot stalking risks, doxxing, and digital footprint exposure.

### Tools & Libraries

#### 1. **Social Media Monitoring**
- **Tweepy**: Python wrapper for the Twitter API, allows monitoring of hashtags, keywords, or user activity.
- **PRAW**: Python Reddit API Wrapper for gathering data from specific subreddits, posts, or comments.
- **Facebook-Scraper**: Tool for scraping Facebook posts, public profiles, and comments.
- **Selenium**: A Python library for automating web scraping tasks, especially for sites without easy-to-use APIs.

#### 2. **Leak Detection**
- **HaveIBeenPwned API**: This API can be integrated to scan emails or usernames to see if they have been part of any known data breaches.
- **Leak-Lookup**: A service that allows searching for leaked credentials and personal information across multiple data dumps.

#### 3. **Image Analysis for Sensitive Data**
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision that can detect patterns and identify objects within images, including sensitive content (like credit cards, keys, or text).
- **Tesseract OCR**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool for extracting text from images, useful for detecting written addresses or other sensitive information.
- **Clarifai**: An API that provides advanced image recognition and can detect objects, scenes, and even sensitive information in images.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Python Imaging Library for basic image manipulation and analysis.
  
#### 4. **Machine Learning (ML) for Threat Detection in Images**
- **TensorFlow**: For developing models to detect specific patterns or objects in photos (e.g., car plates, credit cards, house addresses).
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API to develop and train image recognition models.
- **Pretrained YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: A real-time object detection system that can detect various objects in images with high accuracy.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traceintel.git
cd traceintel
```
#### 2. Set up virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 3. Run the application (To be added as the backend is developed)
For now, use Uvicorn (the ASGI server) to run the FastAPI application:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

```

## Future Plans

- User-friendly dashboard: A web interface allowing users to configure alerts, view logs, analyze images, and track vulnerabilities.
- Advanced Image Analysis: Enhanced photo analysis features to automatically detect personal data leaks in pictures.
- API access: Provide API endpoints for advanced users to integrate TraceIntel into other tools or workflows.
